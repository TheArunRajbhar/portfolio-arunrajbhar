          Greetings!
          <br />
          Frontend-focused Full Stack Developer with 3+ years of experience
          building high-performance, scalable, and user-friendly web
          applications using React, Next.js, and Node.js.
          <br />
          Currently working at Mayhem Studios (MPL), where Iâ€™ve contributed to
          building data dashboards, CMS platforms, and internal tools used by
          cross-functional teams. I specialize in creating responsive UIs,
          integrating APIs, and embedding real-time data visualizations using
          tools like Grafana, Databricks, and Tableau.
          <br />
          Iâ€™m passionate about clean code, test-driven development (TDD), and
          improving developer experience. I enjoy solving real-world problems
          through thoughtful architecture, intuitive UX, and scalable backend
          logic. Iâ€™ve also worked with DevOps tools like Docker, Kubernetes,
          GCP, and CI/CD pipelines.
          <br />
          Whether itâ€™s developing an analytics dashboard, automating internal
          workflows, or enhancing a user-facing web app â€” I focus on building
          solutions that are fast, reliable, and maintainable.
