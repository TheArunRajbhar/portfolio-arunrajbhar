          Greetings,
          <br /> I'm Arun Rajbhar, a dedicated Full Stack Developer based in
          Mumbai, Maharashtra. With a rich background in creating dynamic
          digital experiences, I specialize in cloning sophisticated e-commerce
          websites.
          <br /> My frontend toolkit includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJs,
          and TypeScript, enabling me to build intuitive and visually appealing
          user interfaces. I have a keen eye for detail and ensure a seamless
          user experience through meticulous app testing using Cypress.
          <br /> In the backend domain, I leverage the power of NodeJs and
          Express to construct robust and scalable solutions. Additionally, my
          proficiency extends to mobile app development, where I harness the
          capabilities of Android Studio and Java to craft responsive and
          feature-rich applications.
          <br /> Each project I undertake is a testament to my commitment to
          continuous improvement. I approach challenges with enthusiasm and
          embrace emerging technologies to stay at the forefront of the
          ever-evolving tech landscape. <br /> Explore my portfolio to witness
          the culmination of my skills and passion for building innovative
          digital solutions. Let's connect and discuss how I can contribute to
          your next project.
